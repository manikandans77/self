"My name is Manikandan Shanmugam. I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the area of Smart Agriculture Toolkit.
My research focuses on IoT and machine learning-based smart farming systems that help optimize resources and support farmers with data-driven insights. 
Alongside research, I enjoy teaching programming concepts like C and Python, and I also create educational videos in Tamil to make learning simple for students. 

My goal is to contribute to both education and practical solutions in agriculture through research, teaching, and technology development."
